Slug: `cash-pool-participant`

## Profile overview

## Functions — topics to cover

- **Cash Balance Reporting**: How the entity reports its balances to the pool leader for sweeping and allocation.
- **Internal Funding Requests**: How the entity requests liquidity from the pool when it needs funding.
- **Working Capital Optimization**: How participation supports the entity's working capital and cash flow needs.
- **Cash Forecasting (own entity)**: How the entity forecasts its own cash position for participation planning.
- **Communication with Pool Leader**: How the entity coordinates with the pool leader on limits, terms, and reporting.

## Assets — topics to cover

- **Cash Balances (deposited in pool)**: Excess cash placed in the pool rather than held locally.
- **Working Capital**: Receivables, payables, and inventory that drive cash flow and pool participation.
- **Minimal treasury infrastructure**: Limited systems or staff compared to pool leader; reliance on pool for treasury services.

## Risks — topics to cover

- **Counterparty Risk (vs. pool leader entity)**: Risk that the pool leader cannot return deposits or honor overdrafts.
- **Limited Interest Rate Risk**: Limited exposure to rate changes compared to pool leader (pass-through or fixed).
- **Liquidity Dependency Risk**: Risk of being unable to access pool liquidity when needed (limits, timing, pool stress).
- **Minimal Operational Risk**: Low operational complexity as a participant; most risk borne by pool leader.

Solara Distribution France SAS operates as a full-fledged distributor of consumer electronics products within the French market. The entity maintains its own warehouse facilities, employs a dedicated sales force, and bears significant market and inventory risk.

Unlike a limited-risk distributor, Solara Distribution France independently manages its customer relationships, sets local pricing within group guidelines, and carries finished goods inventory on its own balance sheet. The entity is responsible for local marketing initiatives, after-sales support, and warranty processing.

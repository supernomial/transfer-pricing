The French consumer electronics distribution market generated approximately EUR 18.2 billion in revenue during 2024, representing a 3.1% year-over-year increase driven by continued demand for smart home devices and personal computing hardware.

Key market dynamics include ongoing consolidation among mid-tier distributors, increasing direct-to-consumer channels from manufacturers, and growing importance of after-sales services as a margin driver. France remains the third-largest European market by volume after Germany and the United Kingdom.
